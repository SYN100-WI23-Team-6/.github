## Welcome to Sustainable Cookies! 🍪

Hi! We are students at UC San Diego, who created this project for our university's [Synthesis Program](https://seventh.ucsd.edu/synthesis-program/index.html). 
We built a website raising awareness for food sustainability and environmentalism, with helpful tips on how to reduce food waste and save our planet! 

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
